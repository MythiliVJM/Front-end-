        <h4>Food is what people and animals eat to live. Every organism needs energy to carry on with the process of living which comes from food. Food usually comes from animals and plants. It is eaten by living things to provide energy and nutrition.[1] Food contains the nutrition that people and animals need to be healthy. The consumption of food is normally enjoyable to humans. It contains protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, water and minerals.[2] Liquids used for energy and nutrition are often called "drinks". If someone cannot afford food they go hungry.<br><br>

        Food for humans is mostly made through farming or gardening. It includes animal and vegetable sources. Some people refuse to eat food from animal origin, like meat, eggs, and products with milk in them. Not eating meat is called vegetarianism. Not eating or using any animal products is called veganism.</h4>

         <h2>OUR SPECIAL RICE SET</h2><br>
         <p> Rice staples, Tomato Rice, Paruppu, sambar, rasam, poriyal and koottu are added with butter or curd to prepare pachadi. Dry and fresh fruits or vegetables are also used to prepare traditional cuisine. They serve salt, pickles, payasam, and aviyal. </p><br><br> 
         <h2>Paper dosa served in a cone shape </h2><br>
         <p> There are so many types of Dosas. There are a few famous kinds of dosa which are available all over the country. Let's start with paper dosa. Most of the dosas are paper-thin and like all the other Tamil Nadu Food, it is made by a batter with the mixture of urad dal and rice, spread over a pan and cooked mildly. It is then shaped into a thin paper-like layer and served in a cone shape along with some chutney and sambar. All the other dosas are made in the same way but depending on their names the extra ingredients are added. Like the egg, dosa has the same procedure but an egg is cracked and poured onto the dosa, spread across and cooked along with the dosa in some oil/ghee.
            
            Some other kinds of dosas are:
            
            Tomato Dosa, Onion Dosa, Rawa Dosa, Vegetable Dosa, Plain Dosa, Masala Dosa etc. </p> <br><br>
        <h2>OUR SPECIAL IDLI and VADA</h2>><br>
        <p>Idli and Vada, collectively save breakfasts for people who are late in the mornings, almost every time! These Tamil Nadu food items complement each other beautifully and are total comfort foods. Idli is made with a mixture of urad dal and rice and looks like a small, spongy pancake once cooked and is one of the signature dishes of Tamil Nadu.

        Vada, on the other hand, is either doughnut-shaped or round like idli and is prepared with fermented Bengal gram mixed with curry leaf, cumin seed and mustard seed. The vada is then shaped and deep-fried giving us a crispy yet soft food served with sambar and coconut chutney. </p><br><br>   
        <h2>OUR SPECIAL RICE SET</h2><br>
        <p> Rice staples, Tomato Rice, Paruppu, sambar, rasam, poriyal and koottu are added with butter or curd to prepare pachadi. Dry and fresh fruits or vegetables are also used to prepare traditional cuisine. They serve salt, pickles, payasam, and aviyal. </p><br><br> 
        <h2>PAYASAM</h2><br<br>
        <p>A piquant desert, Payasam is a popular second course in Tamilnadu. This dish is prepared by roasting moong dal and cooking it in a pressure cooker along with adding jaggery syrup and dry fruits.</p><br><br>
        <h2>PRAWNS KUZHAMBU</h2><br><br>
        <p>A perfect epitome of South Indian cuisine is Prawns Kuzhambu, serving as a gastronomic delight in Tamilnadu. The prawns are marinated in masala which gives it a strong tangy taste.</p><br><br>
        <h2>UTTAPAM</h2><br><br>
        <p>This delectable dish is very much similar to dosa but what makes it different is the topping of tomatoes, onions, capsicum, and other veggies. Uttapam tastes heavenly good with either spicy tomato or coconut chutney.</p><br><br>
        <h2>Chicken Chettinad</h2><br>
        <p>This mouth-watering dish is a specialty of the Chettiyar community of Tamil Nadu. Contrary to popular believes, there are many regional non vegetarian dishes within the broad category of Tamil food. Every region has its variations and Chettinad cuisine happens to be one of them. It is chicken marinated in yogurt, turmeric, a variety of spices such as poppy seeds, coriander seeds, cumin seeds and fennel seeds, and other flavour add ons. It can be prepared in a dry or gravy style and is enjoyed with either steamed rice or a rice flour paratha.</h2><br><br>
        <h2>Cuisine in Tamilnadu<br><br>

<p>Tamil Nadu has always been a hub for food connoisseurs to take a great pleasure of some of the finest traditional cuisine in the country. The state is reckoned to be one of the best places in India for offering a bagful of culinary treasure for tourists to savour.
